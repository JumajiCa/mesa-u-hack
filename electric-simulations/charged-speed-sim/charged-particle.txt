problem statements
    have the particle reach a speed at a certain distance based on setting either the charge or initial velocity

given that the stationary charge is a certain charge, then determine the charge for the second particle to reach a certain speed in a certain amount of time.
    


Todo =================

    confirm when the particle is in the expected location





Structure ===================

    overall script to trigger the beginning of movement, and check for when the particle is in the proper position.

Help ========================

    have something to give hints

Auto-Generate New Problems ==========


"Sandbox" ===========================

    just place different particles around and see what happens 

Show "other configurations" =========

    maybe show the problem set up in different configurations to see how the problem would be otherwise solved.

Multiple Particles ===================

    set up so that more particles can be added and placed

"Stepper" ============================

    increment each frame to see how the velocity/acceleration changes at each time in the simulation. 

Show Values(speed, position, acceleration, etc.) =========================

    show the values as they update.

Considerations for "By feeling"

    have it give you messages for being close but not quite there.
